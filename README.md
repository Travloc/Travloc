  final POICache poiCache;
  final WeatherCache weatherCache;
  
  // Async processing
  Future<TripPlan> generatePlanAsync(TripRequest request) async {
    // 1. Check final plan cache
    if (finalPlan = await tripCache.get(request)) {
      return finalPlan;
    }
    
    // 2. Check AI response cache
    if (aiResponse = await aiCache.get(request)) {
      return await enrichWithAPIs(aiResponse);
    }
    
    // 3. Generate new plan
    final plan = await generateNewPlan(request);
    await cachePlan(plan);
    return plan;
  }
  
  // Parallel API enrichment
  Future<TripPlan> enrichWithAPIs(AIResponse response) async {
    final places = await Future.wait(
      response.places.map((place) => 
        poiCache.getOrFetch(place)
      )
    );
    
    final weather = await weatherCache.getOrFetch(
      response.location,
      response.dates
    );
    
    return combineData(response, places, weather);
  }
}
```

class TripPlanningUI {
  // Optimistic updates
  void startPlanning() {
    showLoadingState();
    showSkeletonUI();
    
    // Start async process
    final plan = await tripService.generatePlanAsync(request);
    
    // Update UI progressively
    updateUIWithPartialData(plan);
  }
  
  // Progressive loading
  void updateUIWithPartialData(Plan plan) {
    // Show basic structure
    showDayStructure(plan.days);
    
    // Load details progressively
    for (final day in plan.days) {
      loadDayDetails(day);
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```dart
// Example monitoring
class PerformanceMonitor {
  // Track key metrics
  void trackLatency(String stage, Duration duration) {
    // Log to monitoring system
    // Alert if thresholds exceeded
  }
  
  // Cache hit rates
  void trackCachePerformance(String cacheType, bool hit) {
    // Monitor cache effectiveness
    // Adjust TTLs based on hit rates
  }
}
```

### Error Handling & Recovery
```dart
// Example error handling
class TripPlanningErrorHandler {
  // Graceful degradation
  Future<TripPlan> handleError(Error error) async {
    // Return cached data if available
    // Provide partial results
    // Log for analysis
  }
  
  // Retry strategies
  Future<T> withRetry<T>(Future<T> Function() operation) async {
    // Implement exponential backoff
    // Maximum retry attempts
  }
}
