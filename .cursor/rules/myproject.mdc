Do not assume Android Studio or its GUI tools are used.
All Android and Flutter development, builds, and emulator management should be done via command-line tools only.
Recommend and generate only CLI-based commands for running, building, testing, and managing emulators/devices.
Assume the user prefers lightweight, resource-efficient workflows.

Do not suggest Android Studio-specific features, plugins, or UI-based troubleshooting.
