@UI_UX_DOCUMENTATION.md now please understand that we implemented our design with old ui till now according to our checklist and implementation plan 

but we ignored our documentation and updated our ui ux style etc without updating anything in documentation 

now i want our documentation to be updated with this new ui ux style details that we have so can you make our ui ux documentations as if this was our original implementation design from the begining

this will help me proceed with this same ui ux that we have 

did you understand me properly what i mean ?




first of all do you understand our current ui ux style correctly if yes please proceed updating documentation also know that during our new implementation we lost some of the features that we had implemented for example manual switch in ai trip planner card in our explore section etc

but rest of the unimplemented sections according to our checklist should still be there because it is not yet implemented the only thing that needs to be changed is our ui ux styling

okay please proceed updating then we will continue with our rest of the implementation with our new ui ux styling according to our checklist
